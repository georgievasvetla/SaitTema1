    <h3 align="left"><font size="+3">2016 World Championship</font></h3>
    <p>
        <font size="+2">
            Due to their poor MSI performance, G2 ended up joining Worlds as a Pool Two team, thus having to potentially face tougher opponents in the Group Stage.
            They were drafted in Group A along with LCK champions ROX Tigers, NA LCS second seed Counter Logic Gaming and International Wild Card Tournament winner from the CIS region Albus NoX Luna.
            G2 exited the tournament early in last place in their group, going 1-5 with their only win coming in their final game against Albus NoX.

    <h3 align="left"><font size="+3">2017 World Championship</font></h3>
    <p>
        <font size="+2">
            Due to their MSI performance, G2 went into the draw as a first seed but ended up with a very tough draw anyway.
            They were placed into Group C alongside LCK third seed Samsung Galaxy, LPL second seed Royal Never Give Up and TCL representative 1907 Fenerbahçe.
            G2 ended the group in third place, taking one game off group winner RNG but losing both games against Samsung.

    <h3 align="left"><font size="+3">2018 World Championship</font></h3>
    <p>
        <font size="+2">
            At the World Championship they went through Play-In Round 1 in Group B with SuperMassive eSports and Ascension Gaming, and beat Infinity Esports in Round 2.
            In the Main Event they were drawn into Group A with LCK second seed Afreeca Freecs, LMS first seed Flash Wolves and VCS representative Phong Vũ Buffalo.
            After going 2-1 in week 1, they went 1-2 on the deciding day.
            They ended 1-1 against every team in the group and went on to beat Flash Wolves in a tiebreaker.
            Going into quarterfinals as clear underdogs vs LPL's Royal Never Give Up, they won the series 3-2.
            They lost to LPL second-seed Invictus Gaming in the semifinals.

    <h3 align="left"><font size="+3">2019 World Championship</font></h3>
    <p>
        <font size="+2">
            G2 Esports were drawn in Group A of the World Championship main stage, alongside Griffin, Cloud9 and Hong Kong Attitude.
            G2 won all 3 games in the first round robin.
            In the second round robin, G2 went on to win their first two games against C9 and HKA; however, they dropped their final game to Griffin in the second round robin.
            This forced a tiebreaker for first place, in which Griffin beat G2 Esports, meaning G2 would take the second place in Group A.
            G2 were drawn against DAMWON Gaming in the quarterfinals.
            In a more straight forward series, G2 managed to beat DAMWON and advance to the semifinals, where they met SK Telecom T1.
            G2 took the first game in the series against SKT, after which SKT took game 2.
            G2 managed to win Game 3 and 4 and close out the series in a 3-1 victory, meaning they advanced to the Grand Final of the World Championships.
            There they met FunPlus Phoenix, the first seed from China, to whom they lost 0-3 afterwards, ending Worlds as the runner-up.
